/* Link-only stubs: symbols needed to link nr-softmodem that are NOT
 * provided by real RISC-V shared libs (real libsctp/libz/libopenblas/
 * liblapacke replace the former library stubs). These symbols are baked
 * directly into the executable via an object file appended to the link
 * command, so they do not depend on any stub .so.
 *
 * - asn1c BER/DER runtime: RRC uses UPER, not BER/DER; these are pulled
 *   in only by generic ANY_t/constr_SET_OF support objects, not the RRC
 *   codec path. Stubs report failure so callers take their error path.
 * - OPENSSL_assert: no-op (matches the riscv64-stubs macro override).
 * - __builtin_cpu_init / __builtin_cpu_supports: x86-only GCC builtins;
 *   reporting "no x86 feature" is the CORRECT behavior on RISC-V (OAI
 *   then selects portable code paths; SIMDE handles SIMD separately).
 *   exactly what --noS1 / rfsim wants. */
